# IssueTrackingLite

The IssueTrackingLite application allows the user to view previously entered project issues by clicking on the navigation pane, and then clicking on the specific project in the TableView on the right. The user can also create, save, and  delete issues in the TableView by clicking on the buttons in the upper right-hand corner of the user interface.

This application uses the IssueTrackingLite.fxml file in the resources folder to describe the view of the user interface built in Scenebuilder.
